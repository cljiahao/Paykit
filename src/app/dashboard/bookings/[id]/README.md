# booking detail

`page.tsx` reads the vendor-owned booking and its linked transactions, returns
404 for missing/inaccessible records, and renders payment and booking controls.
Next 16 route params are asynchronous.

## Payment display

The page renders server-generated QR markup only for QR checkouts and passes
that string to the synchronous `transaction-status-card.tsx`. Persisted
`checkout_kind` and `checkout_label` preserve the original link/image identity;
links remain links and uploaded QR images remain images. Unknown older pointer
checkouts show an unavailable-instructions message instead of guessing their
original display type. A displayed instruction is not payment verification.

## Controls

- `recover-deposit-button.tsx` retries deposit setup for a saved booking whose
  initial checkout or guarded link failed.
- `create-balance-checkout-button.tsx` requests the balance after deposit setup,
  while no balance is linked.
- `cancel-booking-dialog.tsx` allows cancellation and optional refund bookkeeping.
  Its refund field appears when exactly one linked transaction is confirmed;
  otherwise refunds remain available from the transaction page.
- `reschedule-booking-dialog.tsx` edits event and balance-due dates.
- `copy-booking-id-button.tsx` copies the identifier for qkit booth linking.
- `print-booking-button.tsx` prints the summary; action controls are print-hidden.

Cancelled bookings hide mutation controls. Every action revalidates its inputs
and ownership; visibility is not authorization. Dialog tests cover successful
close/reset and failed-submit retention. Page/display tests cover missing rows,
control eligibility, checkout kinds and legacy fallback.
