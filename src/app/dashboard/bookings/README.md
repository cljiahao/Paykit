# bookings

Vendor-owned event bookings link a deposit checkout and a later balance checkout.
The database's `sync_booking_status` trigger derives payment progress from
confirmed transactions. Cancellation preserves linked transaction state; it does
not reverse a payment. Due reminders are dashboard badges, not scheduled sends.

## Actions and recovery

`actions.ts` validates amounts/dates and creates the booking through the vendor
session. Deposit creation uses the stable `booking:<id>:deposit` reference.
A checkout or link failure preserves the saved booking and asks the vendor to
retry from its detail page; no compensating booking deletion occurs.
`deposit-actions.ts` and `[id]/recover-deposit-button.tsx` provide that retry.
Service-role link RPCs receive the verified vendor, booking and transaction IDs.
Balance creation follows the analogous guarded `link_booking_balance` path.

Cancellation and rescheduling first read the booking under vendor RLS. Cancel
may also request Pro-gated refund bookkeeping; a failed refund does not undo the
cancellation and is reported separately. Rescheduling updates dates without
inventing a new payment state. Audit helpers live in `lib/admin-audit.ts`.
Peer-kit checkout transitions use the separate `payment_audit` trail.

## Views

`page.tsx` renders `booking-table.tsx` and `new-booking-dialog.tsx`.
The table is a client adapter for shared `DataTable` callbacks. The creation
form derives balance until the vendor edits it; the server always validates
that deposit plus balance equals total. `booking-badges.tsx` shares status and
due indicators with the detail view.

`[id]/` displays payment instructions, deposit recovery, balance creation,
cancel/reschedule, copy-ID and print controls. The booking ID is the value a
vendor can paste into qkit's booth settings.

## Verification

Tests cover scoped reads, validation, retained-booking recovery, guarded links,
returned/rejected failures, cancellation/refund outcomes and dialog behavior.
Mocked action tests do not establish database RLS, locking or trigger behavior.
