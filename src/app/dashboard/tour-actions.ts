/**
 * Client-fired mark-seen: wired as `onFirstSeen` on `@merqo/ui`'s
 * `DashboardTour` (dashboard-tour.tsx), fired the moment the tour auto-
 * starts. Fire-and-forget from the client, so it never blocks the tour
 * itself — but that also means a hard navigation away from the page (e.g.
 * clicking the real "Payment setup" nav link the tour's own second step
 * spotlights — `@merqo/ui`'s `DashboardNav` renders nav links as plain
 * `<a>` tags, not `next/link`, so that's a full page reload) can abort this
 * fetch before it lands. `DashboardPage`'s own synchronous stamp
 * (`stampTourSeen`, called directly from `page.tsx`'s server render) is
 * what actually guarantees the write survives that; this one is just the
 * fast common-case duplicate (the upsert is idempotent either way).
